{\LARGE {\bf \emph{Nico}: An Environment for Mathematical Expression in Schools}}

\end{center}

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the user study for my Part II Project.
\emph{Nico} is a piece of educational software designed to aid learners in the
visualisation of mathematical problems, by separating out the constituent parts
of a calculation into distinct visual units on-screen.

The purpose of this study is to ascertain how well \emph{Nico} achieves its goal
of providing a clear, accessible, interactive means of calculation, and to gather
feedback on how the application could be improved.  The study also aims to compare
\emph{Nico} to traditional mathematical methods.

Please review and sign the attached Statement of Informed Consent (Section 3)
and please feel free to ask any questions you may have about it.

Before we begin, please answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}

\item Have you used \emph{Nico} before?

\begin{center}
Yes\hspace{1cm}No\\
\end{center}

\item How well do you agree with the following statement (cross as appropriate)?\\
\emph{I am confident in my ability to calculate answers to simple mathematical problems.}

\likert

\end{itemize}

Thank you.  Let us begin.

\section{Study}

You will now be issued a group number.  If you are in Group 1, please proceed to
Section 1.1.  If you are in Group 2, please proceed to Section 1.2.  If you would
like to stop at any point, please don't hesitate to let me know.

\subsection{\emph{Nico}}

In this section, you will use \emph{Nico} to solve some simple mathematical
problems.  The purpose of this section is to evaluate how well \emph{Nico}
performs in comparison with manual calculation.  We will be keeping a record of
the time taken to complete each problem, but please do not let this make you feel
rushed.  Work at a pace that is normal and comfortable for you.

Before we begin the tasks, please watch the instructional video
\verb¬qs/tut.avi¬ for a briefing on how to use \emph{Nico} and an explanation
of its controls.

Now that you have done this, please spend 5 minutes experimenting with
\emph{Nico}.  Open the application and load the file \verb¬qs/blank.nqs¬ using
the file chooser.  As you explore, please tell me your thoughts about the
application.

Now, let us move on to the problems.  Please use the {\sffamily {\bf File}} menu
at the top of the screen to load the file \verb¬qs/user-study.nqs¬.  You will
be presented with a series of problems to solve using \emph{Nico}; please solve
them.

Thank you very much.

\begin{itemize}
\item If you are in Group 1, please continue to Section 1.2
\item If you are in Group 2, please continue to Section 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manual Calculation}

In this section, you will solve some simple mathematical problems using pen
and paper.  The purpose of this section is as a control, to compare to your
results using \emph{Nico}.  Once again, we will be keeping a record of the time
you take to complete each question, but please do not let this make you feel
rushed.  Work at a pace that is normal and comfortable for you, and don't forget
to show your working.

Let us begin.

\section*{Welcome to \emph{Nico}!}

\subsection*{Introduction}

\emph{Nico} works by representing the constituent parts of a calculation as
circles containing an operator with arguments orbiting it.  The value of a circle
can be passed to other circles to be used in further calculations, and this is
indicated on-screen by means of a line going from from the edge of the argument
circle to the centre of the circle using it (\emph{Fig. 1}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig1.png}
\caption{Nested circles, representing the calculation \emph{(1+2+3)×4×5×6×7×8}.}
\end{figure}

As the user builds up a diagram, the {\bf {\sffamily Answer}} field in the top
right-hand corner keeps a running total of the calculation, evaluating the circle
that does not use any others as arguments as the root.  Mousing-over a circle
currently in the diagram highlights that circle, and the relevant part of the
{\bf {\sffamily Question}} field that it represents, in blue.

\subsection*{Usage}

Begin by executing either the \verb¬nico¬ (for UNIX-like systems) or
\verb¬nico.bat¬ (for Microsoft Windows systems) file to open the application.
Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a file-chooser dialogue.
Use this to choose a set of questions (a file ending in \verb¬.nqs¬) to complete
using \emph{Nico}.

You are then presented with a screen akin to the one below (\emph{Fig. 2}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig2.png}
\caption{The initial state of the application upon loading a new question set.}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig3.png}
\caption{The dialogue box used for creating a new circle.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

To create a circle, right-click on a blank section of the canvas.  A context menu
will appear, with a {\bf {\sffamily New circle}} option.  Select this option, and
you will be presented with a dialogue box, as depicted in \emph{Fig. 3}.

This dialogue box allows one to initialise a circle with up to eight arguments.
The operator is chosen with the radio buttons in the {\bf {\sffamily Operator}}
field.  The arguments are then set using the {\bf {\sffamily Argument}} fields.
Click on the {\bf {\sffamily Enabled?}} checkbox to use that argument in the
circle.  Choose either the radio button next to the slider or next to the list
of existing circles to specify whether the argument should be a number or
another circle.  If you select the slider, set the slider to the number (limited
to a minimum of -10 and a maximum of 10) you wish to use.  If you select the
list of existing circles, choose the radio button next to the label corresponding
to the circle that you wish to use.  Finally, click on the {\bf {\sffamily OK}}
button to create your circle.

You can add other circles as extra arguments by left-clicking and dragging between
the two circles: from the circle you wish to use to the circle you wish to use it
in.  To remove a circle, simply right-click on a circle and select
{\bf {\sffamily Remove circle}}.  Circles can be repositioned by left-clicking on
a circle and dragging it to the desired new position.

To check your answer, click the {\bf {\sffamily Check}} button in the top right-
hand corner of the window.  If the answer is correct, the {\bf {\sffamily Answer}}
text will turn green, a congratulatory message will pop up, and \emph{Nico} will
move on to the next question.  If your answer is incorrect, the
{\bf {\sffamily Answer}} text will turn red, and you will have the opportunity
to resubmit.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
