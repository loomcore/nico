- fix dnd
- get rid of buttons, more intuitive interface (e.g. popup menus)
- live updating of answer and other stuff, save need for render, evaluate buttons, etc.
/ make questions look like maths not lisp
/ fix next/prev buttons to scroll through qset
- make .nqs default/only filter in file selection dialogue
/ have marking scheme for whole qset (i.e. set :a? and :c? fields to reflect if question was answered and, if so, if it was correct - though now thinking maybe just only let them progress when it's right)
/ maybe instead of next/prev buttons, have it so that it just moves on when you get it right
- splash screen?
- handle window being maximised
