/ make canvas show new-circle dialogue box on detecting a click
/ fix live update for del-circle (currently have to manually render after del)
/ tidy up code
- get rid of last few buttons, info printed in corner
- make .nqs default/only filter in file selection dialogue
- running totals? like what render used to do with this shit:
    (loop [u @used-circles
           y 20]
      (cond (not (empty? u)) (do (doto (.getGraphics (select main-window [:#canvas]))
                                   (.drawString (str (:name (last u)) ": " (eval (eval-circle (last u)))) 20 y))
                                 (recur (butlast u) (+ y 10)))))))

- splash screen?
