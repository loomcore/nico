everything is less shit! :D
- fix that deletion bug
- fix that highlighting bug
- fix that maximising bug
/ change highlighting to draw a thick ring around a circle, rather than a filled circle underneath it
/ change colouring to colour-coding by operation
/ have it so that arg or op currently being edited is highlighted somehow (e.g. bolded)
/ reword declaration in questionnaire
- make tutorial video

everything is shit! :'(
- redo dnd rendering, apparently it doesn't matter if it's flickery
- make circles move out of the way if overlapping
/ make it not print clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList when it evaluates no circles
- click to add a placeholder arg, drag circles to placeholder or click on it to bring up a number input dialogue
- fix highlighting issue where it gets stuck with a blue circle over it (poss. only on macs?)
- fix that NullPointerException that keeps happening for no apparent reason
- remove dialogue box as much as possible, if still keeping it have it dynamically expand and preview the circle being created
/ rethink or fix notation
  / add arrows to circle, indicator of start/finish of args
  / sam suggested expanding boxes (but fuck that, i've done the other one now)
/ make circle-linking lines arrows (have made a circle instead)
/ make circle-linking lines point to the arg, not the centre of the circle

post-meeting stuff to do:-
- improve number entry (spinners or text fields)
/ connecting circles without having to go through the settings (drag between circles)
/ allow users to move the circles (dnd)
- being able to change the operator (and args?)
- basically lose the dialogue box
/ also have a submit button instead of automarking, allows them to break it and see what went wrong
/ highlighting the circle and the part of the sum it represents when the mouse hovers over
- antialias canvas (and poss. text?)
/ get rid of names; user doesn't know why they need to name a circle
/ fix docstrings: they go before [& args], not after

/ make canvas show new-circle dialogue box on detecting a click
/ fix live update for del-circle (currently have to manually render after del)
/ tidy up code
- fix maximising bug; make app properly fullscreen
- get rid of last few buttons, info printed in corner
- make .nqs default/only filter in file selection dialogue

for the future:
- running totals? like what render used to do with this shit:
    (loop [u @used-circles
           y 20]
      (cond (not (empty? u)) (do (doto (.getGraphics (select main-window [:#canvas]))
                                   (.drawString (str (:name (last u)) ": " (eval (eval-circle (last u)))) 20 y))
                                 (recur (butlast u) (+ y 10)))))))

- splash screen?
- save diagrams as pictures?
