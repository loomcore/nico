\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The aim of the project was to develop an application in the Clojure programming
language which would allow users to express mathematical calculations using a
graphical notation.  The software was to be able to generate an abstract syntax
tree from the graphical notation, evaluate it and pass the results back to the
application in under 300ms.  An extension to the project was to conduct a user
study to evaluate the utility of the software.
%
% To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
% complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
% student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
% should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
% should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
% incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
% \LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the Makefile.  It should
% explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
% Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
% finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
% dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

I have successfully designed and implemented the application detailed in the
previous section.  That is, I have developed an application in which it is
possible to express calculations using a graphical notation, that generates an
abstract syntax tree from the language and that is able to parse the tree and
return the results in under 300ms.  I have also conducted a user study to assess
whether or not the software is actually of use with regard to mathematics
education.
%
% All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Learning the Clojure programming language.
%
% Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
% document on both CUS and Thor.

\section*{Declaration of Originality}

I, Philip Michael Yeeles of Selwyn College, being a candidate for Part
II of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation
and the work described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be
specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material
that has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable
purpose.
