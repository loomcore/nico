Nico provides a means of expressing a chain of mathematical reasoning graphically, to aid in the understanding of various methods of calculation.  It is written in Rich Hickey's excellent [Clojure](http://clojure.org) language, a recent dialect of the venerable [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) that runs on top of the [JVM](http://java.com).  It is the subject of my final-year project as part of the Computer Science BA at the University of Cambridge.
